Project Link

Introduction
I decided to create my own Linktree page for my professional wedding photographer Instagram account. Social media presence is essential for credibility these days. Without spending too much time on posts, stories, and reels, I want my profile to attract new clients or visitors to my website, elenamantovanweddingph.com.

Design Choices
My photographic style is documentary and reportage, focusing on elegance, delicacy, intimacy, and naturalness. My website uses a minimalist style with soft colors and three different fonts, aiming for a sober and elegant look to attract specific clients. I decided to keep the same style for my Linktree page.

Research and Inspiration
Website: My primary source of inspiration to maintain consistency.
Pinterest: Linktree inspiration featuring rounded shapes.
Competitor Analysis:
Paro Wuidar: Minimalistic but perhaps too basic Linktree.
Zoë Janssen: Linktree as a webpage matching her site’s design, which I found more cohesive and suitable for my image.
Design Process
Wireframe: Simple and standard with reserved areas for navigation and footer, and three buttons centered on the page. Integrated a header image to add visual appeal.
Color Palette and Typography: Used the same colors and fonts from my website. Soft, light, delicate colors with modern, simple, and elegant fonts. Chosen fonts are Marcellus (elegant, serif) and Overpass (simple, sans serif).
User Interface Development: Created mockups with colors and profile/header images, refined header image shape, added dynamic elements with gradients and shading for buttons, and tested different header images for harmony with page design.
Tools and Technologies
Design Tools: Figma for mockups and design iterations.
Development Tools:
Editor: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Languages: HTML, CSS
Deployment: Vercel for hosting
Development Process
Setup Development Environment:

Install VS Code.
Install necessary extensions (e.g., Live Server).
Clone the Repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/linktree-project.git
cd linktree-project
Open in VS Code:

Open the cloned repository folder in VS Code.
Live Server:

Right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server" to view your project in the browser.
Challenges and Solutions
Hover Animation: Discovered that hover effects are not possible on mobile, so I animated buttons on tap instead.
Button Color Animation: Learned to create component variants and animate them using YouTube tutorials.
Key Learnings
Understanding the management of components and creating variants is crucial for any project. Gained familiarity with Figma and further developed my HTML and CSS skills, which will be useful for future design work.

Feedback and Iterations
Received feedback and inspirations from classmates. Iterated on mockups to add dynamism while keeping the page elegant and minimalistic. Experimented with different header images to achieve the best harmony.

Conclusion
This project combined my course learnings with my current professional activities. It helped me become familiar with Figma and further enhanced my coding skills. I am excited to explore web development further and hope this page attracts new clients via Instagram.

Future Prospects
I am passionate about UI design and web development, especially for mobile screens. I plan to continue exploring these tools and use my knowledge for future employment. I also hope that this page will help attract new clients.
