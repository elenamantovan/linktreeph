Introduction

I decided to create my own Linktree page for my professional wedding photographer Instagram account. Social media presence is essential for credibility these days. Without spending too much time on posts, stories, and reels, I want my profile to attract new clients or visitors to my website, elenamantovanweddingph.com.


Design Choices

My photographic style is documentary and reportage, focusing on elegance, delicacy, intimacy, and naturalness. My website uses a minimalist style with soft colors and three different fonts, aiming for a sober and elegant look to attract specific clients. I decided to keep the same style for my Linktree page.


Research and Inspiration

Website: My primary source of inspiration to maintain consistency.
Pinterest: Linktree inspiration featuring rounded shapes.
Competitor Analysis:
Paro Wuidar: Minimalistic but perhaps too basic Linktree.
Zoë Janssen: Linktree as a webpage matching her site’s design, which I found more cohesive and suitable for my image.
Design Process
Wireframe: Simple and standard with reserved areas for navigation and footer, and three buttons centered on the page. Integrated a header image to add visual appeal.
Color Palette and Typography: Used the same colors and fonts from my website. Soft, light, delicate colors with modern, simple, and elegant fonts. Chosen fonts are Marcellus (elegant, serif) and Overpass (simple, sans serif).
User Interface Development: Created mockups with colors and profile/header images, refined header image shape, added dynamic elements with gradients and shading for buttons, and tested different header images for harmony with page design.
Tools and Technologies
Design Tools: Figma for mockups and design iterations.
Development Tools:
Editor: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Languages: HTML, CSS
Deployment: Vercel for hosting
